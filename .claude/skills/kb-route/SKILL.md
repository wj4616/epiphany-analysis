# kb-route — KB Resolution Procedure

Shared resolution procedure for querying Knowledge Bases. Consumption skills include this by adding:

```
Read and follow the Resolution Procedure in ~/.claude/skills/kb-route/SKILL.md
```

This skill is NOT invoked directly by users. It is a procedure that consumption skills (sound-design-bridge, dsp-implementation, ui-bridge, plugin-spec, daw-testing) reference inline.

## Input Parameters

Consumption skills provide whichever parameters apply to their current task:

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `concept` | Find entries about a technical concept | `"filter resonance"` |
| `bridge_descriptor` | Find bridge translation for a subjective descriptor | `"warm"` |
| `explore` + `layer` | Browse what's available in a layer | `layer="technical"` |
| `kb` (optional) | Target a specific registered KB | `"juce-agent-prototype"` |

If both `concept` and `bridge_descriptor` are provided, Steps 2 and 4 both run. Results are returned grouped (concept results, then bridge results). The consumption skill reconciles — it has the domain context.
